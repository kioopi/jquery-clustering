  * The creation of marker objects in collect_markers needs revisiting. Some more flexibility in gathering the info should be introduced.
  
     * add the same technique for marker gathering as for bunch-node-creation, users can register functions that get the marker-li-dom-node and the marker js-object and can parse the node and add info to the object.  this object is the same that will be passed to bunch-creation. 


  * Dito for the creation of bunch-objects in cluster. Some form of prototype-based aproach comes to mind since these objects contain functions. 

  * differnet images for markers (ie. based on type) could be supported

  * also different images based on how many markers are clustered should be standard functionality

  * the markers collected in a bunch should be appended to the bunch's node as an ul, to enable interactivity down the way.

  


  * mr.crockford thinks inheritance via the new operator isn't cool. 
    right, now it works, though.
